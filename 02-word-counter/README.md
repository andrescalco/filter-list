# 01 - Filter List

Your goal is to create a function, using Javascript, where a table's result is filtered according to a user's input, in a text field.

You must use, plain javascript, without any framework (angular, jquery, ember, vue, etc).

Also, you need create a seperated js file, and inclued it in the index.html file in this repo.

If you wish, you can make unit tests, as well.

Good Luck!
