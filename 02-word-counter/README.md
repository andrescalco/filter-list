# 02 - Word Counter

Your goal is to create a function, using Javascript, that returns the quantity of words and characters, according to an user's input on a textarea.

At every typed word, the values must be updated to the user, and fill the table, with the following information:

* Words
* Characters
* Characters (no spaces)

You must use, plain javascript, without any framework (angular, jquery, ember, vue, etc).

Also, you need create a seperated js file, and inclued it in the index.html file in this repo.

Good Luck!
