# 03 - Select the Pairs

Your goal is to create a function, using Javascript, that returns if the current two selected words are matching pairs. Also, you need to shuffle the order of the words.

Wich state of the application have a current color:

* Default staus: badge-default
* Active status: badge-primary
* On Success: badge-success
* After Success: badge-disabled
* On Error: badge-danger

You must use, plain javascript, without any framework (angular, jquery, ember, vue, etc).

Also, you need create a seperated js file, and inclued it in the index.html file in this repo.

Good Luck!
